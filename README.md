(let me know if you want to try it out, I need you to be **registered as a member**. More on this later.) 

I have only tested it with the [Phantom wallet](https://phantom.app/) so


# what it is

## Blockchain - Solana

BENTO DAO is a dApp deployed in the [Solana](https://solana.com/) devnet. Solana is a environmental friendly, fast and cheap Blockchain.

|       | Ethereum | Solana |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| speed | - 3min | - 12 sec |
| tx cost | $ 10 | $ 0.001 |
| market cap | 2nd | 10th |
| consensus | PoW* | PoS|

*: Ethereum will shift to PoS eventually. 

There are also differences in smart contract development, but the main reason is the speed and the cost of each interaction.

## Social Choice function - Approval Voting

[Previously](https://github.com/namaph/namaph-multisig) have worked on a multisig based DAO. Since my my main claim towards current DAOs is that they are too simplistic
in aggregating the votes. I choose Approval Voting for this step. Approval voting enables you to pick Approval / Denial for each option. It is used for election through the world
and have been popular among social choice theorists. Some say AV renders more satisfaction than IRV, and is extensible to other methods. But it is not perfect.

Also AV can be used to **acquit** bad choices, and is a good match for this application. For example, if you chose a high impact burger (5.0 kgCo2e) you can
approve another lighter Salad (0.2 kgCo2e) to balance it out. AV has a characteristic that you cannot favor other options the others, I'm exploiting this aspect.
